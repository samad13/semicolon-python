 2.5 (Circle Area, Diameter and Circumference) For a circle of radius 2,
display the diameter, circumference and area. Use the value 3.14159 for π.
Use the following formulas (r is the radius): diameter = 2r, circumference
= 2πr and area = πr . [In a later chapter, we’ll introduce Python’s math
module which contains a higher-precision representation of π.
